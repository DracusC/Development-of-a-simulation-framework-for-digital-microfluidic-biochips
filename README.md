*Microfluidic Biochip Simulation Framework*

<br>

## Background

***MB : `Microfluidic Biochip`***

<br>

Our research group currently works on **MB** <br>
software & hardware, including firmware.

<br>

### Digital MB

Digital **MB** allow the execution of biological <br>
& chemical protocols on chip-scaled devices.

This delivers cost / performance advantages <br>
over traditional bench-top wet lab processes.

Computer-based simulation is beneficial as it <br>
allows testing of biochemical protocols before <br>
the real experiment.

The simulator can also be used to assist <br>
users during the protocol's execution.

<br>

### Scope

The aim of the project is to develop a simulation <br>
engine for the digital microfluidics platform that <br>
is currently being built at the **DTU Compute**.

It will have the capability to simulate the behavior <br>
of the biochip & droplets using interacting models. <br>

These models will be used for the droplets, <br>
biochip actuators and sensing elements.

<br>

#### Core Components

- ***Simulator Engine***

- ***Graphical User Interface***

- ***Mathematical Models***

  *These analytical / stochastic models will* <br>
  *capture physical / biochemical behaviors.*

<br>

#### Planned Models

- Droplet Volume

- Vicinity Interaction

- Temperature Gradients

<br>

#### Plugins

The simulator should have support for future plugins <br>
of more refined behavioral models and offer handles <br>
for in-droplet reaction kinetics simulation.

<br>

#### Interface

The simulators UI presents the simulation state <br>
and manages user interactions during simulation.

<br>

#### Integration

The entire solution should be able to be <br>
integrated with the existing framework.

<br>

### Comparison

A comparison between the ***simulated*** and the ***real*** <br>
 behavior of a protocol running on a biochip can be <br>
 used as the main evaluation metric of the simulator.
